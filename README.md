## Who needs this?

If you have a Coinbase account and don't want to pay the 1.5% fee for buys, you can use GDAX (they're owned by the same company so you already have a GDAX account if you're on Coinbase) instead and schedule your recurring crypto buys using the GDAX API + AWS Lambda. GDAX fees are a much-nicer .25%. Pretty sweet.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have [Serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/) installed and your [AWS credentials are set up](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/).

Next, clone the repo and install dependencies.

```
git clone git@github.com:alfonsogoberjr/gdax-lambda-buyer.git
cd gdax-lambda-buyer && yarn
```

### API Keys

If you haven't already, make sure you create [Sandbox](https://public.sandbox.gdax.com/settings/api) (if you want to test buy with fake money) and [Production](https://www.gdax.com/settings/api) GDAX API keys. You will need to log in to both the Sandbox and Production versions of GDAX, located at https://public.sandbox.gdax.com and https://gdax.com, respectively.

If you plan to use Sandbox money (not real fiat currency), you will also need to "deposit" by going to the Sandbox site at https://public.sandbox.gdax.com/trade/BTC-USD and clicking "Deposit" > "Coinbase Account". There should be a fake USD wallet pre-populated for you with some money. Specity the amount of fake money you want to deposit and click "Deposit funds".

If you only plan to use real money (USD/EUR), you only need to deposit funds on the real GDAX site.

Next, create a file called `credentials.json` with the following contents:

```
{
  "dev": {
    "gdaxURI": "https://api-public.sandbox.gdax.com",
    "gdaxPassphrase": "your-sandbox-passphrase",
    "gdaxAPIKey": "your-sandbox-api-key",
    "gdaxAPISecret": "your-sandbox-secret"
  },
  "prod": {
    "gdaxURI": "https://api.gdax.com",
    "gdaxPassphrase": "your-prod-passphrase",
    "gdaxAPIKey": "your-prod-api-key",
    "gdaxAPISecret": "your-prod-secret"
  }
}
```

Save and close. This file is listed in .gitignore so you don't have to worry about accidentally checking it in to Git.

### Adjust Parameters

Take a look at `serverless.yml`. The relevant sections are listed below.

```
...

  environment:
    ...
    FIAT_AMOUNT: 10       # The amount of fiat you wish to exchange for crypto
    FIAT_TYPE: 'USD'      # The type of fiat you plan to use. Also supports EUR/GBP
    CRYPTO_TYPE: 'BTC'    # The type of cryptocurrency you wish to buy.
...

functions:
  buy:
    handler: handler.buy
    events:
      - schedule: rate(7 days) # Change this to your liking.

...

```

So with the default settings, gdax-lambda-buyer will buy $10 worth of Bitcoin every week.

You can also replace `FIAT_AMOUNT=10` with `CRYPTO_AMOUNT=0.1` and buy 0.1 BTC every week. Change to 100 and you'd buy 100, etc. The possibilities are endless (as long as your bank account is ðŸ’¸).

Note that ETH and LTC are supported in prod, but not in the sandbox for some reason. So stick to BTC if you're using sandbox money.

## Test

You don't have to deploy at all, if you just want a quick way to purchase, say, $10 worth of BTC you can run

```
yarn run test-prod
```

and the function will run with your settings immediately.

Deploying is only necessary for the recurring buy feature.

## Deploy

```
yarn run deploy
```

will deploy your scheduled Lambda function to production, which will run on your specified schedule.
